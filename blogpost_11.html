            <h2>Xfce 4.20 Pre1 Released</h2>
            <p>Dear Xfce community, I am happy to announce the release of Xfce4.20 pre1.</p>

            <p>Xfce 4.20 Pre1 is a platform pre-release, which gives early adopters the possibility to test the new release and to check for compatibility.</p>

            <p>Further implications for the pre1 release:<p>
            <ul>
                <li>In order to increase stability, no new features will be added to Xfce core components until the final release.</li>
                <li>We will not add new strings either, in order to give translators the possibility to reach a complete translation for the final release.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A detailed overview on the major changes introduced in Xfce4.20 will be given for the final release, <a href="https://wiki.xfce.org/releng/4.20/roadmap">planned for December 15th</a>.</p>

            <p>Xfce4.20 pre1 includes all Xfce core components. The tarballs for building it can be found here:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://archive.xfce.org/xfce/4.20pre1/src">Download individual tarballs</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://archive.xfce.org/xfce/4.20pre1/fat_tarballs">Download one tarball which includes all releases</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Though, you might prefer to wait for distribution specific development packages.</p>

            <h2>Wallpaper Contest for Xfce 4.20</h2>

            <p>Like for Xfce 4.18 I would like to ask the Xfce community to contribute a few wallpapers. Everyone will have the opportunity to vote on them to elect the new default wallpaper for Xfce 4.20.</p>
            
            <p>If you possess the required skills, your contribution would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>Like the <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/artwork/public/-/tree/master/wallpapers">old Xfce wallpapers</a>, the new wallpaper should be a vector graphic with an unmodified <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/artwork/public/-/tree/master/logo">Xfce mouse</a> on it and some fancy shapes.</p>

            <p>Note that the image must be all yours and needs to be licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>. If you do not specify a license in your post, then we will assume that you are licensing the image under the CC BY-SA 4.0.</p>

            <p>The image should not mention the software (FOSS or proprietary) used to create the wallpaper in the metainfo.</p>

            <p>The deadline for submissions is the 15th of November. Like that, we will have two weeks left for voting and integration of the new wallpaper into the Xfce pre2 release.</p>

            <p>In order to participate, take a look at the <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/artwork/public/-/issues/2">Xfce wallpaper contest GitLab issue</a>.</p>

            <p>Please note that this year only the &#10084;&#65039; emoji will be considered as an upvote, in order to simplify vote counting. You can upvote as many wallpapers as you like.</p>
