            <h2>GSoC 2022 has finished for Xfce - a brief summary</h2>
            
            We are happy to anounce that all our Xfce GSoC participants, namely Yogesh Kaushik, Amrit Borah and Pratyaksh Gautam all successfully finished thair GSoC projects.
            
            Here a short sumup on the projects:
            
            Yogesh Kaushik
            
            Amrit Borah
             
            Pratyaksh Gautam
            
            <p>Probably you already heared that <a href="https://wiki.xfce.org/releng/4.18/roadmap">Xfce 4.18 is planned to be released</a> on 15th Dec. this year.</p>

            <p>It would be nice to have a new default wallpaper for that release. This time the idea is to ask the Xfce community to contribute a couple of wallpapers. With a community vote the default Xfce 4.18 wallpaper than can be selected.</p>
            
            <p> So if you have the required skills, your contribution would be very welcome !</p>

            <p>Like the <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/artwork/public/-/tree/master/wallpapers">old Xfce wallpapers</a>, the new wallpaper should be a vector graphic with an unmodified <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/artwork/public/-/tree/master/logo">Xfce mouse</a> on it and some fancy shapes.</p>

            <p>Note that the image must be all yours and needs to be licenced under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>. If you do not specify a licence in your post then we will assume that you are are licensing the image under the CC BY-SA 4.0.</p>

            <p>The image should not mention the software (FOSS or proprietary) used to create the wallpaper in the metainfo.</p>

            <p>Deadline for submissions is the 20th of November.</p>

            <p>In order to participate, post your wallpaper into the <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/artwork/public/-/issues/1">corresponding gitlab issue</a> !</p>
