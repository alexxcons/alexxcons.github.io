            <h2>Xfce 4.18 Pre2</h2>
              <p>Dear Xfce community, I am happy to announce the release of Xfce4.18 pre2.</p>

              <p>This platform pre-release consists of the Xfce core components and will be followed by the final Xfce4.18 release soon. We fixed some quirks which were found in Xfce4.18 pre1, did some further polishing and the result is now released as Xfce4.18 pre2.</p>
              <p>Early adopters are invited to give it a try and to check for compatibility before the final release, which is <a href="https://wiki.xfce.org/releng/4.18/roadmap">planned for 15. December</a>.</p>

              <p>Xfce4.18 pre2 includes all Xfce core components and can be found here:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://archive.xfce.org/xfce/4.18pre2/src">Download individual tarballs</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://archive.xfce.org/xfce/4.18pre2/fat_tarballs">Download one tarball which includes all releases</a></li>
              </ul>

            <h2>Wallpaper contest</h2>
              <p>It is a pleasure for me to present you the outcome of our <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/artwork/public/-/issues/1">Xfce4.18 wallpaper contest</a>, which received numerous nice wallpaper submissions.</p>
              <p>The winner wallpaper, which will be the new Xfce4.18 default wallpaper was brought to you by Katerina Shkel:</p>
